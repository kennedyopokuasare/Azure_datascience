# Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure

**Microsoft Azure Machine Learning** provides the cloud infrastructure, DataStores, scalable and on-demand compute, machine learning workflows for production-grade Machine Learning. Azure offers tools for the full lifecycle of Machine Learning, including the productionization and monitoring of models.

In previous Machine Learning work [[1](https://github.com/kennedyopokuasare/IBM_datascience), [2](https://github.com/kennedyopokuasare), [3](https://github.com/kennedyopokuasare/carat-analysis)], I have executed entire machine learning pipelines, from data cleaning to prediction, using my personal computer, Jupyter Notebook, and Snakemake for workflow management. There are bottlenecks when training machine learning models with large datasets on a personal computer with limited resources, especially when multiple experiments need to be conducted â€” a case in point is when I trained [five machine learning algorithms to predict the depression status of participants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574119222000566) as part of my PhD research.

This repository presents a project where I use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Cloud services for training, inferencing and Productionization of Machine Learning Models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In `Azure ML Studio`, notebooks can be run just like you would on your computer. First, you need to provision a `compute instance` that will run the computations in the notebook.

For instance:

* I explored the student grades and hours of study dataset and examined the distribution of the students' grades. [Source](./With_code/02-visualize-data.ipynb)
* I used the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster the seeds dataset based on two principal components of the dataset. [Source](./With_code/01-clustering-introduction.ipynb)

## Automated Machine Learning in Azure ML studio

`Automated Machine Learning` allows for automated training of multiple machine learning models, in parallel to predict a target, without the need to write code. AutoML selects the best models and data transformations based on a the estimator's metrics.

### AutoML completed, with MaxAbsScaler and XGBoostRegressor

In the screenshot, the AutoML selected the best model `XGBoostRegressor` with `MaxAbsScaler`based on metrics such as the `Normalized root mean square error`. The registered and deployed with a Real time endpoint.

### Explaining the AutoML regression model

For model explanability, the AutoML generates the feature importance for all features. It is possible to show the best K features usign the UI. In the screen shot, `workingday`, `temperation`, `year` and `humidity` were the best 4 features that explained the prediction of bicyle rentals.

Several metric to access the performance of the model is generated by AutoML. The AutoML also generates plots such as the Redisual plots for Regression models that can be use to qualitatively access the model's performance.

import json

endpoint = "<END-POINT-URL-HERE>"
key = "<API-KEY-HERE>"

payload = {
    "Inputs": {
        "input1":
        [
            {
                'Age':43,
                'PatientID': 1882185,

                'Glucose': 104,
                'BloodPressure': 51,
                'SkinThickness': 7,
                'Insulin': 24,
                'BMI': 27.36983156,
                'DiabetesPedigreeFunction': 1.3504720469999998
            },
        ],
    },
}

#Set the content type and authentication for the request 
headers = {"Content-Type":"application/json", "Authorization":"Bearer " + key} 
input_json = json.dumps(payload)

#Send the request 
response = requests.post(endpoint, input_json, headers=headers) 
response.text

if response.status_code == 200: 
    y = response.json()  
    output = y["Results"]["WebServiceOutput0"][0]
    print("Predictions:") 
    print('Patient: {}\nPrediction: {}\nProbability: {:.2f}'.format(
        output["PatientID"],
        output["DiabetesPrediction"],
        output["Probability"]
    ))

    print(response)
